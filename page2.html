  <h2>My Biggest Project</h2>
  
  <section class="house">
    <h3>How I Got There</h3>
    <p>In the summer of 1984 I had been married for two and a half years and our son was a year and a half old, when we found out we were
      expecting baby number 2! We were living in a 2 bedroom condo, and the family was growing faster than expected. My wifes dad was a
      General Contractor/Carpenter by trade and had purchased a number of lots in the town of Oak Forest, when he approached us with an idea -
      he asked if we would be interested in purchasing one of the lots, and "we" would build a house on it! At the time I was working full
      time, and also taking night classes to complete my B.S. degree in computer science. After much thought and prayer, we decided to take
      on the project.
    </p>   
    <h3>The Plan</h3>
    <p>We got started by selecting plans for a 4 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom house, and my father-in-law George quickly set the wheels in motion. My
      brother-in-law Don was also a carpenter and was currently working for an energy auditing firm, but also agreed to help whenever he
      was available. Since we were all working full time - our time to work on the house was generally nights and weekends.

    <h3>The Work</h3>

      <p>The first week of September 1984 we broke ground to begin
        the adventure! In addition to George and Don who worked tirelessly, there were
        too many others to mention that came to help with the construction or even just the manual labor of hauling materials or cleaning up
        the work area. I wasn't clueless when it came to which end of the hammer to use - my dad was a "do everything" kind of guy, so I recalled
        days in the garage either helping work on a car or doing a "fix it" project around the house. In spite of that, my father-in-law George
        was amazing to put up with me as one of his main helpers for 9 months. Here is a picture of my 2 year old son helping Grandpa George
        start to build the first floor!</p>
      <p>We had done just about everything, with the exception of the cement and brick work, and the plumbing. I got to experience working on framing,
        insulation, drywall, electric, roofing, tiling - you name it, I got a chance to do it. There were many nights where 2 hours of sleep had to
        be enough! I really enjoyed that kind of work, and it was very rewarding. I actually got hooked on watching a show called "First Time Flippers",
        which is a show about people who decide to buy a house to fix it up and resell it to make a profit. It is hilarious to watch some of these
        people get started, who have no idea about tools, construction or what it takes to start, let alone complete, a project like that. If you
        ever decide to try it - check out this link to see what you may be in for!

    <h3>The Fruits Of Our Labor</h3>
    <div class="picblock">
      <p><img src = "pics_videos/housepic2.jpg" alt = "House Now" class="imgright" />On May 28, 1985 almost a full 9 months after breaking ground on "The Big Project" - we moved into our new home! We had a new addition to
        the family as our daughter was born in the middle of construction. After that we would have one more girl, in order to fill up that fourth
        bedroom. Almost 34 years later we are still living in that house - as empty nesters! Now my kids have houses of there own, and whenever
        there is a project to do - dad is the first one to get a call!

        Here is a picture of our finished product after 34 years.
